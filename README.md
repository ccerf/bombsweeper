# Bombsweeper

Bombsweeper is my version of the classic Minesweeper game !

This project was the opportunity for me to try a few things.  
First of all, Angular `standalone components` with Angular v15.  
It was also my first shot at `Tailwind CSS` (<3)  
Finally, I deployed the project to `Firebase`.   
You can find the game right here : https://bomb-sweeper-5143c.web.app/   
Will you beat my high score ?
